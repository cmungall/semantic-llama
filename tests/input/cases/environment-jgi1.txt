Title: Fungal, bacterial, and archaeal communities mediating C cycling
and trace gas flux in peatland ecosystems subject to climate change

Abstract:
Metagenome and metatranscriptome analyses. In the second part of this study we will conduct in-depth analysis to integrate metagenomics and metatranscriptomics studies that will leverage two i
ntensive peatland climate change experiments: PEATcosm (USDA & NSF funded) and SPRUCE (DOE funded). The PEATcosm experiment is investigating the effects of water table and peatland vegetation on trace gas flux in bog ecosystems. Dominant vascular plants (heath and sedge family) are hypothesized to be key ecosystem engineers that influence microbial community structure both via symbiotic associations that have strong extracellular enzyme activity (Ericaeae), and by transport of oxygen and labile C into the peat (Carex).  We will investigate 8 microenvironments: Ericaceae and sedge rhizosphere peat, at two depths, in both high and low water manipulative treatments simulating anticipated climate-mediated changes in water balance. We anticipate collecting 3 replicate samples per sample type to be used for both metagenome and metatranscriptome seque
ncing; each set of 3 could be pooled on a single lane of Illumina HiSeq, bringing the total to 16 lanes. The SPRUCE experiment is designed to understand threshold level responses of a peatland system to experimental warming.  It features fourteen plots that will be heated over a temperature gradient of 0 to +9 Â°C above ambient, factorial with CO2 enrichment over a 10yr period.  The experiment is being constructed in Minnesota with heating scheduled to begin in spring of 2014. Pretreatment environmental, vegetation and biogeochemical data has already been collected over the last 3 years.  To complement such efforts, we are requesting analysis from 70 samples representing spatial and depth variation across the bog (14 plots/5 depths). Our goal is to provide baseline data on community functional genomic potential (metagenomic DNA) and their activities (metatranscriptomic RNA) in order to guide future intensive investigations at this site.  We anticipate multiplexing of up to 10 DNA or RNA samples per lane of the HiSeq for a total of 14 lanes of capacity for this part
