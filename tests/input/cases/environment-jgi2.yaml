Development of genomic resources for Sphagnum magellanicum (Bryophyta: peat moss) is proposed to enable genetic and molecular research related to environmental genomics, phylogenetics of early land plants, population genetics, and speciation. Most significantly, peat mosses, and Sphagnum magellanicum specifically, have tremendous impacts on global carbon budgets and climate. The phylogenetic position of Sphagnum as an early diverging lineage of land plants adds value to the project, and molecular tools enabled by such a resource will promote the continuing (and expanding) utilization of Sphagnum for research in population genetics and evolution.

There is one other bryophyte genome (Physcomitrella patens) that is designated as one of JGI’s Flagship Genomes. While Physcomitrella has some advantageous features for functional genomics, the species is very rare in nature, is poorly characterized ecologically, and, as a tiny annual species, is not suitable for research on carbon cycling or climate change. Therefore, our proposal will leverage genomic resources already available for Physcomitrella by establishing a modern genomic resource for Sphagnum magellanicum, which is an important plant species with regard to carbon sequestration. A Sphagnum resource will also increase the value of Physcomitrella as a model flagship species and establish a plant model of tremendous importance for climate change research.

Sphagnum (peat moss) arguably has a greater impact on global carbon fluxes and therefore climate than any other single genus of plants. Peatlands develop where net production exceeds decomposition over extended time and some Sphagnum-dominated peatlands have accumulated tens of meters of partially decomposed plant material that store some 400 gigatons of carbon. Sphagnum magellanicum is a dominant species in peatlands throughout the subarctic and boreal zones, extends southward to subtropical Florida in the U.S., and through the Andes to Tierra del Fuego. It is estimated that approximately 30% of terrestrial carbon is stored in peatlands that occupy only about 10% of the earth’s land surface. Low decomposition rates in Sphagnum-dominated peatlands result from a combination of abiotic conditions (cold temperatures, low nutrients, anoxia) and biological features of the Sphagnum plants themselves. Although uniformly slow to decompose relative to vascular plants, different species of Sphagnum are characterized by variable rates of decomposition and species-specific traits scale up to impact community structure and ecosystem function. Understanding the nature and genetic basis of variation in functional traits that impact Sphagnum growth and decomposition is essential for making predictions about ecosystem consequences of ongoing climate change. Important functional traits with substantive ecosystem-scale consequences include whole plant productivity and decomposition rates, nitrogen and phosphorous contents, foliar pH, and production of Sphagnum acids. While Sphagnum serves an important primary role in carbon dynamics of high-latitude ecosystems, it also serves a secondary role in insulating permafrost, thus dampening the influence of rising temperatures on vast amounts of carbon stored in arctic tundra. Some of these traits co-vary with microhabitat specialization among Sphagnum species, enabling research that connects field studies of species biology and community structure, ecosystem function, global carbon fluxes, and control of past, present, and future climate.
