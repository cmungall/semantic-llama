Tortilla Soup

Ingredients
1 rotisserie chicken or 3-4 cups poached chicken
1 (15 oz) can fire roasted tomatoes, diced
1 (10 oz) can red enchilada sauce, mild
1 small onion, chopped
1 medium zucchini, sliced into 1/4-inch half circles
1 (4 oz) can green chilies
4 cloves garlic, minced
4 cups chicken broth
1 (14.5 oz) can creamed corn, undrained (can sub with 1 can sweet corn, drained)
1 tsp ground cumin
1 tsp chili powder
1 tsp sea salt
1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper
3 bay leaves

Garnish
4 Tbsp chopped cilantro
1 lime cut into wedges
sour cream
cheese, shredded (cheddar, mozzarella, Mexican blend)
1 large avocado, sliced
Tortilla chips, crushed

Method
While rotisserie chicken is still warm, pick all meat of the bones, discard skin. Place the chicken meat in a large stock pot. Discard bones, or save if you like to make homemade stock.
Add to the pot the tomatoes, enchilada sauce, chicken broth, onion, zucchini, chilis, garlic, corn, cumin, chili powder, salt, pepper and bay leaves. Stir to combine and turn the heat to high.
As soon as soup begins to boil, turn the heat to medium-low heat and continue to cook, uncovered, until the onions are translucent and zucchini is tender, about 30 minutes.
Serve the soup topped with chopped cilantro, a squeeze of fresh lime juice, sour cream, cheese, avocado and corn chips.
