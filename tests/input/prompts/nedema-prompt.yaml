     Amelogenesis imperfecta type 1K (AI1K) is characterized by hypoplastic enamel of all teeth. In some individuals, the pulp chambers may be enlarged and some molars may exhibit taurodontism
     Amelogenesis imperfecta segregated as an autosomal dominant trait in the family described by Smith et al.
     amelogenesis imperfecta type IK (AI1K) is caused by heterozygous mutation in the SP6 gene (608613) on chromosome 17q21.

    Familial hemiplegic migraine-2 (FHM-2) is a rare subtype of familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) characterized by migraine with aura, 
    nystagmus, and progressive cognitive decline. It is caused by mutations in ATP1A2.

     neurodevelopmental disorder with eye movement abnormalities and ataxia (NEDEMA) is caused by heterozygous mutation in the FRMD5 gene.
     Neurodevelopmental disorder with eye movement abnormalities and ataxia (NEDEMA) is characterized by global developmental delay apparent from infancy. Affected individuals show delayed walking with an unsteady gait, variably impaired intellectual development, learning disabilities, and speech difficulties. Abnormal eye movements, which are often noted in early childhood, include opsoclonus, nystagmus, and strabismus. Some patients have seizures, which may be refractor.
     Lu et al. (2022) reported 8 unrelated patients, ranging in age from 3 to 27 years, with a similar neurodevelopmental disorder and de novo heterozygous mutations in the FRMD5 gene. The patients presented in infancy with global developmental delay and showed delayed walking, variably impaired intellectual development, and poor or absent speech. Those that achieved walking had an unsteady gait, and most had hypotonia and ataxia; a few demonstrated spasticity. Some patients had dyslexia or learning disabilities. Six patients had seizures or evidence of seizures, including 2 patients who were diagnosed in infancy with refractory epilepsy and West syndrome. All patients had eye movement abnormalities, ranging from strabismus and intermittent esotropia to opsoclonus and nystagmus. Two were visually impaired and had myopia or hypermetropia. Brain imaging was normal in most patients, but one had pachygyria and another had delayed myelination. A few patients had additional features such as myoclonus, dystonia, dyskinesia, and behavioral problems. 
     Inheritance:
     The heterozygous mutations in the FRMD5 gene that were identified in most patients with NEDEMA by Lu et al. (2022) occurred de novo.
