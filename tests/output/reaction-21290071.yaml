input_text: 'Title: Substrate specificity of Rv3378c, an enzyme from Mycobacterium

  tuberculosis, and the inhibitory activity of the bicyclic diterpenoids

  against macrophage phagocytosis


  Abstract

  The Rv3378c gene product from Mycobacterium tuberculosis encodes a diterpene synthase
  to produce tuberculosinol (3), 13R-isotuberculosinol (4a), and 13S-isotuberculosinol
  (4b) from tuberculosinyl diphosphate (2). The product distribution ratios are 1
  : 1 for 3 to 4 and 1 : 3 for 4a to 4b. The substrate specificity of the Rv3378c-encoded
  enzyme was examined. The 3 labdadienyl diphosphates, copalyl diphosphate (CDP) (7),
  ent-CDP (8), and syn-CDP (9), underwent the conversion reaction, with good yields
  (67-78%). Copalol (23) and manool (24) were produced from 7, ent-copalol (25) and
  ent-manool (26) from 8, and syn-copalol (27) and vitexifolin A (28) from 9. The
  ratio of 23 to 24 was 40 : 27, that of 25:26 was 22 : 50, and that of 27:28 was
  16 : 62. Analysis on a GC-MS chromatograph equipped with a chiral column revealed
  that 24, 26, and 28 consisted of a mixture of 13R- (a) and 13S-stereoisomers (b)
  in the following ratio: ca. 1 : 1 for 24a to 24b, ca. 1 : 5 for 26a to 26b, and
  ca. 1 : 19 for 28a to 28b. The structures of these products indicate that the reactions
  of the 3 CDPs proceeded in the same fashion as that of 2. This is the first report
  on the enzymatic synthesis of natural diterpenes manool, ent-manool, and vitexifolin
  A. Both Rv3377c and Rv3378c genes are found in virulent Mycobacterium species, but
  not in avirulent species. We found that 3 and 4 inhibited the phagocytosis of opsonized
  zymosan particles by human macrophage-like cells. Interestingly, the inhibitory
  activity was synergistically increased by the coexistence of 3 and 4b. Other labdane-related
  diterpenes, 13-16 and 23-28, had little or no inhibitory activity. This synergistic
  inhibition by 3 and 4 may provide further advantage to the impairment of phagocyte
  function, which might contribute to pathogenicity of M. tuberculosis.
