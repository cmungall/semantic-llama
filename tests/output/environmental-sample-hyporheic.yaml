text: "Sediment communities from the hyporheic zone of the Columbia River along the\
  \ Hanford Reach were sampled from April 30, 2014 to November 25, 2014, using sand\
  \ packs deployed at three equivalent hyporheic zone locations approximately 100m\
  \ apart along the river (T2, T3, and T4) for six weeks at a time [22]. Water chemistry\
  \ data taken in parallel at the three sites showed similar, yet not identical temporal\
  \ patterns. A mid-year shift in hydraulic regime was observed, with higher influx\
  \ of surface water in the spring resulting in higher levels of dissolved organic\
  \ carbon (measured as non-purgeable organic carbon) (NPOC) (0.8\u20131.0 mg/L) (Fig\
  \ 2A) and low levels of nitrate (10\u201315 \u03BCM) (Fig 2B), transitioning to\
  \ a more groundwater-influenced condition in the fall, increasing the nitrate concentrations\
  \ (up to 300 \u03BCM) and decreasing NPOC concentration (down to <0.4 mg/L). Because\
  \ the groundwater in this system is oxic, the DO concentration was fairly constant\
  \ for the duration of sampling, ranging from ~60\u2013100% saturation (Fig 2C).\
  \ The water temperature followed expected seasonal trends, warming in the summer\
  \ and cooling in the fall (Fig 2D). Sampling times were categorized as early (Apr\
  \ 30 through Jul 22) or late (Sep 2 through Nov 30), based on these observations.\n"
