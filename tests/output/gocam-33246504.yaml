input_text: "Text: An allosteric interleukin-1 receptor modulator mitigates\ninflammation\
  \ and photoreceptor toxicity in a model of retinal\ndegeneration\n\nBackground:\
  \ Inflammation and particularly interleukin-1\u03B2 (IL-1\u03B2), a pro-inflammatory\
  \ cytokine highly secreted by activated immune cells during early AMD pathological\
  \ events, contribute significantly to retinal neurodegeneration. Here, we identify\
  \ specific cell types that generate IL-1\u03B2 and harbor the IL-1 receptor (IL-1R)\
  \ and pharmacologically validate IL-1\u03B2's contribution to neuro-retinal degeneration\
  \ using the IL-1R allosteric modulator composed of the amino acid sequence rytvela\
  \ (as well as the orthosteric antagonist, Kineret) in a model of blue light-induced\
  \ retinal degeneration.\n\nMethods: Mice were exposed to blue light for 6 h and\
  \ sacrificed 3 days later. Mice were intraperitoneally injected with rytvela, Kineret,\
  \ or vehicle twice daily for 3 days. The inflammatory markers F4/80, NLRP3, caspase-1,\
  \ and IL-1\u03B2 were assessed in the retinas. Single-cell RNA sequencing was used\
  \ to determine the cell-specific expression patterns of retinal Il1b and Il1r1.\
  \ Macrophage-induced photoreceptor death was assessed ex vivo using retinal explants\
  \ co-cultured with LPS-activated bone marrow-derived macrophages. Photoreceptor\
  \ cell death was evaluated by the TUNEL assay. Retinal function was assessed by\
  \ flash electroretinography.\n\nResults: Blue light markedly increased the mononuclear\
  \ phagocyte recruitment and levels of inflammatory markers associated with photoreceptor\
  \ death. Co-localization of NLRP3, caspase-1, and IL-1\u03B2 with F4/80+ mononuclear\
  \ phagocytes was clearly detected in the subretinal space, suggesting that these\
  \ inflammatory cells are the main source of IL-1\u03B2. Single-cell RNA sequencing\
  \ confirmed the immune-specific expression of Il1b and notably perivascular macrophages\
  \ in light-challenged mice, while Il1r1 expression was found primarily in astrocytes,\
  \ bipolar, and vascular cells. Retinal explants co-cultured with LPS/ATP-activated\
  \ bone marrow-derived macrophages displayed a high number of TUNEL-positive photoreceptors,\
  \ which was abrogated by rytvela treatment. IL-1R antagonism significantly mitigated\
  \ the inflammatory response triggered in vivo by blue light exposure, and rytvela\
  \ was superior to Kineret in preserving photoreceptor density and retinal function.\n\
  \nConclusion: These findings substantiate the importance of IL-1\u03B2 in neuro-retinal\
  \ degeneration and revealed specific sources of Il1b from perivascular MPs, with\
  \ its receptor Ilr1 being separately expressed on surrounding neuro-vascular and\
  \ astroglial cells. They also validate the efficacy of rytvela-induced IL-1R modulation\
  \ in suppressing detrimental inflammatory responses and preserving photoreceptor\
  \ density and function in these conditions, reinforcing the rationale for clinical\
  \ translation.\n\nKeywords: Inflammasome; Inflammation; Interleukin-1; Interleukin-1\
