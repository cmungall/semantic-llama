input_text: "Sly syndrome, also called mucopolysaccharidosis type VII (MPS-VII), is\
  \ an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease caused by a deficiency of the\
  \ enzyme \u03B2-glucuronidase. This enzyme is responsible for breaking down large\
  \ sugar molecules called glycosaminoglycans (AKA GAGs, or mucopolysaccharides).\
  \ The inability to break down GAGs leads to a buildup in many tissues and organs\
  \ of the body. The severity of the disease can vary widely.\n"
