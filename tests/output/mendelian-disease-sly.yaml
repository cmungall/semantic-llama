text: "Sly syndrome, also called mucopolysaccharidosis type VII (MPS-VII), is an autosomal\
  \ recessive lysosomal storage disease caused by a deficiency of the enzyme \u03B2\
  -glucuronidase. This enzyme is responsible for breaking down large sugar molecules\
  \ called glycosaminoglycans (AKA GAGs, or mucopolysaccharides). The inability to\
  \ break down GAGs leads to a buildup in many tissues and organs of the body. The\
  \ severity of the disease can vary widely.\n"
