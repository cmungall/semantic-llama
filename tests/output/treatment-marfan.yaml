text: "The treatment of Marfan syndrome is directed toward the specific symptoms that\
  \ are apparent in each individual. Treatment may require the coordinated efforts\
  \ of a team of specialists including geneticists, surgeons, cardiologists, dental\
  \ specialists, eye specialists (ophthalmologists), orthopedists, and other healthcare\
  \ professionals.\n\nIndividuals with Marfan syndrome are encouraged to avoid competitive\
  \ and contact sports, heavy lifting and any exercise that increases the strain on\
  \ the aorta produced by rapid or vigorous beating of the heart or increased blood\
  \ pressure. Restriction of such activities can slow the rate of the widening of\
  \ the aorta (aortic dilatation) and decrease the tendency for aortic tear (dissection).\
  \ In general, moving types of exercises performed in moderation are thought to be\
  \ good for people with Marfan syndrome. Such exercises, performed regularly, will\
  \ naturally lower heart rate and blood pressure.\n\nBeta-adrenergic receptor blocking\
  \ drugs (\u03B2-blockers) such as propranalol or atenolol are often used in treating\
  \ the cardiovascular problems associated with Marfan syndrome. Such drugs help to\
  \ reduce the strength and frequency of the contractions of the heart. In doing so,\
  \ they may reduce the strain on the walls of the aorta. Beta-blockers may delay\
  \ the need for heart surgery. The dosage needs to be adjusted to the individual\
  \ patient\u2019s needs, and therapy should be closely monitored. Some individuals\
  \ may not be able to tolerate these drugs and others such as those with asthma or\
  \ depession may not be able to take them (contraindicated).\n\nA second class of\
  \ blood pressure medication called angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) is commonly\
  \ used in the treatment of cardiovascular problems associated with Marfan syndrome.\
  \ This includes medications such as losartan or irbesatan. There is experimental\
  \ evidence that ARBs can help by both lowering blood pressure and by blocking TGF-\u03B2\
  \ activity. In animal models of Marfan syndrome the protective effects of ARBs was\
  \ superior to that seen with \u03B2-blockers. In clinical trials, ARBs have variably\
  \ been shown to be either better than or as good as \u03B2-blockers in suppressing\
  \ aneurysm growth, but this may not be true for all patients or in all circumstances.\
  \ In the largest trial performed to date, young patients receiving \u03B2-blockers\
  \ (at high dosing) or ARBs (at standard dosing) had a comparable decline in the\
  \ deviation of the aortic root size from that expected for age and body size (decreasing\
  \ aortic root z-score). While both treatments were well tolerated in this study,\
  \ in general, ARBs are thought to be better tolerated than \u03B2-blockers. It is\
  \ the stated position of the Marfan Foundation that the choice of treatment should\
  \ be guided by the particular circumstances. A combination of \u03B2-blocker and\
  \ ARB therapy can be considered in circumstances where one or the other type of\
  \ medication does not achieve an adequate response.\n"
