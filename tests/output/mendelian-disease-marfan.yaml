input_text: Marfan syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects connective tissue,
  which is the material between cells of the body that gives the tissues form and
  strength. Connective tissue is found all over the body and multiple organ systems
  may be affected in individuals with Marfan syndrome. The heart and blood vessels
  (cardiovascular), skeletal, and eye (ocular) systems are most often affected. Major
  symptoms include overgrowth of the long bones of the arms and legs, abnormal side-to-side
  curvature of the spine (scoliosis), indentation or protrusion of the chest wall
  (pectus deformity), dislocation of the lenses of the eyes (ectopia lentis), nearsightedness
  (myopia), widening (aneurysm) and tear (dissection) of the main artery that carries
  blood away from the heart (aorta), floppiness of the mitral valve (mitral valve
  prolapse) and backward flow of blood through the aortic and mitral valves (aortic
  and mitral regurgitation). The specific symptoms and the severity of Marfan syndrome
  vary greatly from person to person. Marfan syndrome is inherited as an autosomal
  dominant trait, meaning that only one abnormal copy of the Marfan gene inherited
  from one parent is sufficient to have the condition. Defects or deletions (pathogenic
  variants) of the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene have been shown to cause Marfan syndrome.
