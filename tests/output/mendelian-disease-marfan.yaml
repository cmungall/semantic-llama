text: Marfan syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects connective tissue, which
  is the material between cells of the body that gives the tissues form and strength.
  Connective tissue is found all over the body and multiple organ systems may be affected
  in individuals with Marfan syndrome. The heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular),
  skeletal, and eye (ocular) systems are most often affected. Major symptoms include
  overgrowth of the long bones of the arms and legs, abnormal side-to-side curvature
  of the spine (scoliosis), indentation or protrusion of the chest wall (pectus deformity),
  dislocation of the lenses of the eyes (ectopia lentis), nearsightedness (myopia),
  widening (aneurysm) and tear (dissection) of the main artery that carries blood
  away from the heart (aorta), floppiness of the mitral valve (mitral valve prolapse)
  and backward flow of blood through the aortic and mitral valves (aortic and mitral
  regurgitation). The specific symptoms and the severity of Marfan syndrome vary greatly
  from person to person. Marfan syndrome is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait,
  meaning that only one abnormal copy of the Marfan gene inherited from one parent
  is sufficient to have the condition. Defects or deletions (pathogenic variants)
  of the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene have been shown to cause Marfan syndrome.
